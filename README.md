# Tomato-Disease-Prediction

🍅 Tomato Disease Prediction System
📌 Overview

The Tomato Disease Prediction System is a deep learning–based web application that detects diseases in tomato leaves using image classification.
The system allows users (farmers, researchers, or students) to upload an image of a tomato leaf and receive:

✅ Disease name

✅ Confidence of prediction

✅ Recommended treatment solutions

✅ Downloadable PDF report

✅ Multilingual support (English / Hindi / Tamil)

This project demonstrates the practical use of Computer Vision and Machine Learning in Agriculture to help with early disease detection and crop management.

🎯 Objectives

Detect tomato leaf diseases automatically using a trained CNN model.

Provide instant diagnosis through a user-friendly web interface.

Assist farmers with treatment recommendations.

Reduce manual inspection effort and improve crop yield.

Showcase an end-to-end ML pipeline from training to deployment.

📂 Dataset

Dataset contains ~87,000 images of tomato leaves.

Covers 38 classes including healthy and multiple disease categories.

Images are organized into train / validation directories.

Data includes variations in lighting, angle, and background to improve generalization.

🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

Key Layers:

Convolutional Layers → Extract visual features

ReLU Activation → Introduce non-linearity

MaxPooling → Reduce dimensionality

Fully Connected Dense Layers → Classification

Softmax Layer → Multi-class prediction

Why CNN?

CNNs are highly effective in detecting:

Texture patterns

Spots and discoloration

Leaf structure anomalies
